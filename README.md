# Elevens-Game

Played on JPanel.

The objective of this game is to use all of the cards in the deck to create pairs that add up to 11 in total. 

All royals are removed together as a trio to create their “pair”.

Once a pair is removed by a player, that play gets 1 point. The player with the highest number of points would win the game.

Can be played as a solitaire game as well.
